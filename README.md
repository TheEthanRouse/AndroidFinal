# AndroidFinal
My android final project was to create an application which could calculate reward points, such as flight miles, and let the user know where they fall in the rankings. My project actually took the number of cookies someone would eat weekly. The application starts on a splash loading screen where a sâ€™more slides across the screen. Then the user is asked the number of cookies an individual ate in a week, and this number is written to a file within the phone. From this activity page the user is sent to a single activity page that changes based on their input. This activity page utilizes different animations such as alphas and rotations, and the text changes as well. The application also utilized error handling to prevent crashing.
